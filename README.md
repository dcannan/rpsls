# rpsls
A simple angular app that lets the user play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

# installation
This app was tested with a simple node.js server, which I have included, called server.js, as well as on Wamp.

To use with node.js, simply run the server.js file as a node app in your IDE, or from the command line as $node server.js

To use with Wamp, Lamp, or Mamp, just copy all of the files to your www folder, and start the server

# usage
To use the app, just go to your browser, and go to localhost/rpsls/rpsls.html (These are the paths I used, if you put all of the folders into the root of your www or application folder, then you can go to localhost/rpsls.html)
