# rpsls
rpsls is a simple Angular app for playing the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

# Installation
To install, download the folders and files, and put them in a location you'll remember, like the C drive, in a folder called rpsls

The files include a server.js file to use if you want to run a simple node.js web server.  To use the node.js web server, start the server.js file either through your IDE, running the server.js as a node application, or from the command line by using: $node server.js

To use Wamp, Lamp, or Mamp, just copy the rpsls folder into your www folder on your web server, or local machine, and start apache.

# Usage
Once your server is started, you can test the app out by going to http://localhost/rpsls/rpsls.html
